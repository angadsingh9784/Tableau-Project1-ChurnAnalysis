## Description
Hello Everyone, Today I am sharing my first project in Tableau, my experience to use Tableau is very good as I have to create a different sheets for different charts, by which i easily manage my charts in different tabs and sharing my project to public is easy if i comparing with PowerBi and after i share my project on public, I also able to see my project on my mobile which is also responsive, and here is a question which i raise from datset and i get the answer from my dashboard below : ,

Question:
How does the distribution of monthly charges influence customer churn, 
and are there geographical patterns in churn rates over different cities?
[Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product]

Answer:
Conclusions and Answer of the question

The distribution of monthly charges includes a clear affect on customer churn, with a significant churn rate observed around the $200 monthly charge point. This suggests that clients may discover the value at this price point to be insufficient. Moreover, Arcadia shows higher churn rates compared to other cities, likely due to nearby components such as competition, financial conditions, and benefit quality issues.To address these challenges, it is recommended to:

Reevaluate and potentially adjust the pricing strategy around the $200 mark.Implement targeted retention efforts in high-churn cities like Arcadia, including localized promotionsand enhanced support.Improve service quality, particularly in areas with high churn rates.Collect and act on customer feedback from Arcadia to address particular pain points.
